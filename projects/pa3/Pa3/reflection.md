When I was prgramming this assignment the hardest actualy coding problem I came accross, that wasn't the one bug
that kept me at a full halt for a day,was in setting up my function that removed the color red. I am 
still having a difficult time writing in the syntax so its taking me a long amount of time to have to look 
everything up in excruciating detail and almost copy how they havethier syntax. I can perform the logic in my 
head fine, but it still took me 30 minutes to realize that I forgot to put the "break;" statements inbetween my 
switch cases because I wasnt paying attention when copying the syntax. I will have to say that my knowledge has
grown and I am now coding faster than I was in the proir weeks. The next problem was I was overly cautious and 
I put in errors that ultimatly made my code not work, but it was also thanks to these errors that I knew that 
my program was getting held up there and that helped me when I used the breakpoints to step through everything.
I was unable to make the function that removed the color return it as an vector because I would have to build
a constructor, and plainly I didnt have all the knowledge or the time. The thing I most enjoyed about this 
assignment is that time that I wasn't at my computer coding but doing other things, walking between classes, 
working, or housework, i'm always thinking about my code. See I know how to properly set up the logic in my
and I'll come up with steps on how to do this and then run into errors and find pseudocode solutions and work
the program in my head until it gets to much to remember, and thats when its time to go and sit back down and 
take another crack at it and then code away. And the hardest part of was trying to identify my fatal error 
where I forgot my const in front of my char in the header file declaration and looked over it for about a 
whole day. But it has been a formative learning experience, because now I know that, if manageable, to have 
someone else go over it with you line by line until you can find the error. Also I made a duplicate project 
to test on so I wouldnt permanently breaking anything and the windows I was editing were from different projects.
Since it can be accomplished simply with a switch operator instead of an if function in the remove color 
function maybe you should include the part about removing all colors in this project.
