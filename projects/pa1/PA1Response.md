The hardest thing that I had to deal with when doing this project is that
 I have no experience with git or GitHub. After having some help setting 
 up the fork and learning the commit, push, pull system the next problem 
 that I had was that I had a hard time merging the two files. At first, 
 I ran into an error that even though I had renamed the different file 
 to the new name it would not let me commit the files. I spent all a 
 whole night trying to figure out how to solve the problem without 
 having to edit the code. My friend advised me that I can just throw in 
 a comment to force a commit, and thereby force a merge. Once I committed 
 and pushed the file, I then had to merge it. I looked up some of the 
 gittortoise references and they were a bit too dense for me at first so 
 I looked up some other online instructions and would read them and try 
 to relate it back to the gittortoise page and then I would fix these 
 changes in my merge file. Something I would tell others is that I 
 wouldn’t be afraid to look up extra tutorials that are dumbed down to 
 wrap your head around it, as long as you come back to the reference 
 and relate the simple words to the references because it will build 
 your vocabulary and will make it easier to read these references in the
 future. I did find it exciting to learn about how to use the base functions
 of GitHub and am looking forward to learning how to use more of its 
 functions and getting better at using it overall. Something I would 
 like to learn how to take advantage of is that you are able to make 
 changes and do merges to your GitHub files right in your Visual Studio editor.
 I would think that this would be advantageous because it would remove 
 another step and I could resolve my merged files in the IDE, and I could
 then push and pull from IDE as well would again remove steps and therefore
 make me a more efficient coder.
